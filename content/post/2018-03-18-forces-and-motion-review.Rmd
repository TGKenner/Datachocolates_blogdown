##Distance, Speed and Velocity
* Define vector
A vector is anything that has direction. For example: velocity, acceleration, weight
*What two things must a vector always have?
Magnitude and direction.
*Distinguish (explain the difference) between distance and displacement.
Distance only has magnitude but displacement has magnitude and direction. Distance is a scalar and displacement is a vector.
Speed = distance/time, and velocity = displacement/time in a direction.
*What are the units for distance and displacement?
Distance can be measured in m, cm, inch, km, mi and displacement is all of them with direction. Example = 5m NW
*Define speed and its units
Speed is how fast something moves and its units are m/sec or km/hr or mi/hr
*What are the two types of speed?
Constant and instantaneous speed. Constant is the average speed (how far an object travels over that period of time) and instantaneous is speed at an instant in time.
