###Description

**Started: December 27th, 2015**

**Updated: January 27, 2016**

**Project**: Explore and Calculate Statistical Concepts (*mean, median*, and *range*) we learned during our Grade 5 Math class, in a programming language "R".


**Deliverables**:

1.  A Website that details our project's reproducible research **(Started: Dec 27th, 2015 - Done: February 6th, 2016)**
2.  Our mean, median, and range functions written in R **(Started: Mid-December 2015 - Done: January 22nd, 2016)**
3.  Plots of our data using the ggvis package **(Done: January 29th, 2016)**
4.  A web Application (shiny app) in R **(Work In Progress)**
5.  Certification of Completion of **Introduction to R** by Datacamp **(Done: January 7th, 2016)**

**Our Journey**:

1.  We started our project on October 1st, 2015.

2.  We started learning the R programming language by signing up for an interactive **Introduction to R** course offered by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home).  The course has 6 chapters: Intro to Basics, Vectors, Matrices, Factors, Data Frames, Lists. 

3.  We will be completing all the 6 chapters and programming exercises by the end of next week, January 7th, 2016.  **This is Done**

4.  We started our website for our project's reproducible research on December 27th, 2015.  **Updated it on January 25th/27th 2016 and February 6th/8th 2016**

4. We have completed building our R application, but we will attempt to build the R Shiny web application by the first week of February 2016.


Below is a sample of R code that we have written so far:

```{r}
#Build the character and numeric vectors and assign it to the variables
districts<-c("District1", "District2", "District3", "District4", "District5", "District6", "District7", "District8")
months<- c ("May", "June", "July", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
score<- c (5,7,15,12,0,2,6,6)

#Build the data frame NaughtyNice using the data.frame function
NaughtyNice <-data.frame(districts, months, score)

#Print the dataframe NaughtyNice
NaughtyNice
```


```{r}
#plot the score vector on the y-axis and districts on the x-axis
plot(NaughtyNice$score, type = "p", xlab = "Districts", ylab = "Scores")
#plot(NaughtyNice)
```

```{r warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#load required libraries
library(ggvis)
library(dplyr)
library(gtools)
```


**Using the read.csv function and ggvis package for plots**
```{r}
#we can also read data files in R by using the function read; in this case we are reading a csv file that contains data for our naughtynice score and store it in a dataframe object csvnicenaughty
csvnicenaughty<- read.csv("../../static/data/testscore.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

#Then we plot the score from the data file using the ggvis plotting package in R
#We use the %>% or pipe function which passes saved data to the function group_by
#which then passes it to the function ggvis for the plot.  The %>% lets makes the 
#code easier to write and understand. 

csvnicenaughty %>% group_by(Districts) %>% ggvis(x = ~Districts, y = ~Score) %>% layer_bars(fill = ~Districts)
```
```{r}
#We can also use the box-plot or the box-whisker plot using the ggvis package, so we can see the median and range of the scores.
csvnicenaughty %>% group_by(Districts) %>% ggvis(x = ~Districts, y = ~Score) %>% layer_boxplots(fill = ~Districts)
```
```{r}
#We will now write our own functions and compare the result to the same in-built functions in R

#Our mean function
ownmean <- function(x) {
  meanresult <- sum(x)/length(x)
  return(meanresult)
}

#Call own mean function on csvnicenaughty data
ownmean(csvnicenaughty$Score)
#Compare to built-in mean function in R
mean(csvnicenaughty$Score)

```

```{r}
#Our range function
ownrange <- function(x) {
  totalnum <- length(x)
  sortednnice <- sort(x, decreasing = FALSE)
  rangeresult <- sortednnice[totalnum]-sortednnice[1]
  return(rangeresult)
}

#Call own range function on csvnicenaughty data
ownrange(csvnicenaughty$Score)
#Compare to built-in range function in R
range(csvnicenaughty$Score)
```
```{r}

ownmedian <- function(x) {
  sortednnice <- sort(x, decreasing = FALSE)
  #divide the total number of scores by 2 to find the mid point
  halflength <- length(x)/2
    if (odd(length(x))) {
      sortednnice[halflength+1]
    }
  else {
     (sortednnice[halflength]+sortednnice[halflength+1])/2
  }
  
}

#Call our own median function on our stored data
ownmedian(csvnicenaughty$Score)

#call R's in-built median function
median(csvnicenaughty$Score)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#R shiny app is work in progress

# inputPanel (
#   selectInput("month",
#                   label = "Choose TimeFrame",
#                   choices = list("October", "November", "December", "January", "All"))
# )

#   renderPlot({
#    if(input$month != "All")
#    {
#      plotdata <- csvnicenaughty %>% filter(Months == input$month) 
#      ggvis(plotdata, x = ~Districts, y = ~Score) %>% layer_bars(fill = ~Districts)
#      
#    }
#    else {
#      ggvis(csvnicenaughty, x = ~Districts, y = ~Score) %>% layer_boxplots(fill = ~Districts)
#    }
#   })
```

###Challenges we faced
These were the challenges that we had to deal with when learning R and completing the project:

1.  Learning the new syntax of R
2.  Writing the functions
3.  Finding the mistakes in our R code

###The Fun Part

1. Seeing our code work
2. Collecting the data points 
3. Creating the dataframe

###Future with R
We plan to continue learning R by:

1. Completing Intermediate courses offered by DataCamp
2. Making a shiny application 
3. Learning the ggvis package offered by DataCamp
