<h3>1. Did changing the concentration of the solid affect the change in temperature of the reaction? Why do you believe this is so?</h3>
<p>Yes, changing the concentration affected the temperature. In the vinegar+Baking soda experiment, the temperature reached its equilibrium at <span class="math inline">\(11^0\)</span>C with 5 grams. The second trial reached its equilibrium at <span class="math inline">\(9^0\)</span>C with 10 grams and the third trial reached its equilibrium at <span class="math inline">\(8^0\)</span>C with 15 g.<br />
In the Hydrogen + yeast experiment, the temperature reached its equilibrium at <span class="math inline">\(32^0\)</span>C with 3 grams. The second trial reached equilibrium at <span class="math inline">\(30^0\)</span>C with 6g. The third reached the equilibrium at <span class="math inline">\(30^0\)</span>C with 9 grams. The higher the concentration of the solid, the lower the temperature. It is inversely related.</p>

<div id="does-graphing-your-data-result-in-a-straight-line-explain-why-the-graph-looks-the-way-it-does." class="section level3">
<h3>2. Does graphing your data result in a straight line? Explain why the graph looks the way it does.</h3>
<p>No, graphing the data does not result in a straight line. With the Vinegar Baking soda data there is a negative correlation since it is exothermic. With the Hydrogen Peroxide + Yeast, there is a positive correlation. Both data sets have a curved live. This is because the temperature is increasing/decreasing at inconsistent rates. If the temperature increased/decreased at the same frequency, the lines would be straight.</p>

<h3>3. Claim: Which of the reactions was endothermic? Evidence: How do you know? Use data and be specific</h3>
<p>Yeast + Hydrogen peroxide is an endothermic reaction. Endothermic means the chemicals final energy is greater than the starting/initial energy. The first trial starts at <span class="math inline">\(15^0\)</span>C and ends at <span class="math inline">\(32^0\)</span>C. The second trial starts at <span class="math inline">\(13^0\)</span>C and ends at <span class="math inline">\(31^0\)</span>C. The third trial starts at <span class="math inline">\(12^0\)</span>C and ends at <span class="math inline">\(30^0\)</span>C. When plotted, the data points show a positive correlation. The starting temperature in all 3 trials were less than the equilibrium. Therefore the yeast + hydrogen peroxide is an endothermic reaction.</p>

<h3>4. Claim: Which reaction was exothermic? Evidence: How do you know?</h3>
<p>Vinegar + Baking Soda is an exothermic reaction. Exothermic means the final energy is less than the starting energy. The first trial that starts at 17 and ends at 11. The second trial starts at <span class="math inline">\(15^0\)</span>C and ends at <span class="math inline">\(9^0\)</span>C. The third trial starts at <span class="math inline">\(15^0\)</span>C and ends at <span class="math inline">\(8^0\)</span>C. When plotted, the correlation is negative. In all the trials, the starting temperature was greater than the equilibrium; Therefore, Vinegar + Baking soda is a exothermic reaction.</p>
