In my Physics class, we are learning about forces and Newton's Laws.
I will create a function that calculates force in Newtons.

```{r}
ForceEquation <- function(mass, acceleration) {
  
  F = mass*acceleration
  return(F)
}
ForceEquation(6, 22)
```
```{r}
MassEquation <- function(force, gravity_a) {
  
 M = force/gravity_a 
  return(M)
}

MassEquation(196, 9.8)
```
