<p>I love to read and compose poetry and this poem is one that I wrote for my grade 7 Language Arts class. Thus, I was pleasantly suprised when I came across <a href="https://yihui.name/en/2018/06/quote-poem-blogdown/">Yihui’s blog</a> because I never knew that I could integrate my passion for poetry with my passion for R. Thank you so much Yihui; I appreciate it. What I’d like to attempt is a sentiment analysis using <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html">Julia Stilge’s Text Mining with r</a> so I can see the general feeling my poem gives out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What We Take For Granted</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My fellow gentlemen, take some advice from me<br />
As I wander around eternally<br />
Thinking of how I paid the ultimate cost<br />
A silent spectator to all I have lost</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me start at the beginning in New York city<br />
Where I met a young lady, clever and pretty<br />
We had dinner and drinks at Le Bernardin<br />
And danced until dawn at the downtown scene</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A week later she informed me “I’m studying for the bar”<br />
And laughed as I almost tripped into a car<br />
“It’s not very feminine”, my words left hanging<br />
“This is 1964” she frowned, “the world is changing”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Months later I proposed and we moved in together<br />
In a luxury penthouse just off 21’st and Heather<br />
She bought a hi fi phono and let it blast<br />
100 little records of rock, rhythm and jazz</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the weekdays I worked my 9 to 5<br />
Managing numbers for the Wall Street jive<br />
And every night I came home to our dinner table<br />
And we ate her roasted chicken with sugar maple<br />
Oh, didn’t it seem as though I had I all?<br />
Wealthy and charming at functions and balls<br />
With a beautiful fiance, never dull never aged<br />
When she found employment, all of that changed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, I was not a misogynistic man<br />
Nor did I want her dressed in gloves and fans<br />
But we all have a place, come destiny or doom<br />
And a young woman’s place is not in a courtroom</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You should have heard the screaming and the yelling<br />
She was deaf to all reason, deaf to my tellings<br />
Deaf to my warnings and deaf to my pleading<br />
I only ever kept a lookout for her well being</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That evening I was in a terrible rage<br />
Drove like a madman, revved the pedal gage<br />
So to the loads traffic I paid no attention<br />
Not seeing the cars coming from all directions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When we collided it was as if time had froze<br />
Then back came reality, in three sharp blows<br />
The sirens, the commotion, a crescendo of screams<br />
The smell of blood mingling with petrol gasoline<br />
For as long as I could remember, I had always feared dying<br />
But I felt no fear, not at all terrifying<br />
The emotion that filled me was bitter regret<br />
Of all of the things that her and I had said</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mourning for the life I could have lived<br />
For I could take and take but never give<br />
Regret for not appreciating, opposed to being glad<br />
Regret for the best thing that I never had</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now for my sentiment analysis on a set of my poems that I have saved as a pdf file. Let’s load the required libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

<p>Now I will load my poems from the pdf file</p>
