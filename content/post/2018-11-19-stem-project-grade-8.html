<h3>Title</h3>
<p>Investigating Chemotaxis by Analyzing the Effect of Glucose/Caffeine on Physarum Polycephalum cultures.</p>
</div>
<div id="abstract" class="section level3">
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>How will Physarum Polycephalum respond towards varying concentrations of glucose and caffeine? My hypothesis stated that the Physarum Polycephalum will grow towards the higher concentrations of glucose, and away from coffee. Following the online procedure from <a href="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project-ideas/MicroBio_p028/microbiology/chemotaxis-slime-mold#procedure">Science Buddies/Studying Chemotaxis in Physarum</a>, Physarum plasmodium cultures were grown in petri dishes and then added as <code>0.5cm x 0.5cm</code> blocks (total of 4 blocks) onto the junction of 2 filter strips, one soaked in distilled water and the other soaked in various concentrations of glucose, per petri dish(*5 for 5 petri dishes); the same process was repeated for various concentrations of coffee. For various concentrations of glucose, the results of trial 1 and trial 2 were not consistent. Trial 1 results showed positive growth (growth towards the glucose strip) for glucose cocentrations &gt; 1mM (milliMolar), while Trial 2 results showed negative growth (Growth away from the glucose strip) for concentrations &gt; 1Mm. Trial results for coffee showed no growth (positive, negative or neutral) after a 2 day observation. Based on the results from both the glucose and coffee trials, determining chemotaxis on Physarum Polycephalum cultures per my hypothesis is inconsistent and therefore inconclusive.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I wanted to do a project that involved observations in nature and apply statistics on those observations. We take our 10-lb dog Prince on a walk everyday around the Jordan Woods Natural Area, and I’ve noticed slime molds on fallen trees…etc…This got me interested in learning more about slime molds. Per this article <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/slime-molds-remember-but-do-they-learn-20180709/" class="uri">https://www.quantamagazine.org/slime-molds-remember-but-do-they-learn-20180709/</a>, there are more than 900 different species of slime molds, and a particular fascinating read (also cited in “Background Information”), titled “Slime molds crack 3 of the biggest issues in the U.S” by Robby Berman, that summarizes the results of the experiments by Jonathon Keats using slime molds to crack those 3 biggest issues (Destruction of our climate, The opioid epidemic, and immigration) motivated me to further understand these problem-solving, habituated-learning and smart “neuron-less and brain-less” Physarum Polycephalum via a project.</p>

<h3>Terms and Concepts (cited from Science Buddies; please see Background Information)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Physarum: Physarum is a genus of mycetozoan(grouping of slime molds) slime molds and Physarum Polycephalum is one of its species.</li>
<li>Eukarytotic: Organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within membranes.</li>
<li>Slime mold: An informal name given to several kinds of unrelated eukaryotic orgranisms. Physarum Polycephalum is a member of slime mold.</li>
<li>Protist: Any eukaryotic organism that is not an animal, plant or fungus. The slime mold is classified as a protist.</li>
<li>Plasmodium: The vegetative phase of a two part life-cycle of a slime mold. It consists of networks of protoplasmic veins, many nuclei, and lives as a shapeless, growing blog during moist, warm weather. It’s color varies from gray, cream, colourless, to bright yellow or orange. It is during this stage that it searches for food.</li>
<li>Fruiting body: During the second phase of a slime mold, when the environment is dry, the shapeless, growing blob transforms into small stock-like fruiting bodies that are full of dust like spores.</li>
<li>Environmental cue: The information a physarum plasmodium has to rely on in search of food. It uses the information to decide whether to move towards a food source or away from the harmful substances.</li>
<li>Chemical cue: The chemical information that a plasmodium uses to decide whether to move towards or away from the chemical in question.</li>
<li>Chemotaxis: When an organism moves in repsonse to a chemical stimulus. Movement toward a higher concentration of chemical in question is termed as positive chemotaxis, while a movement in the opposite direction is negative chemotaxis.</li>
<li>Physarum polycephalum: One of the slime molds that literally translates to “many-headed slime”. It is a unicellular organism that lives in dark, cool and humid areas such as leaf litter and other organic debris.</li>
<li>Millimolar concentration: Measurement unit for the concentration of an ingredient in solution.</li>

The Consortium’s secret? It brings a unique perspective to these issues. “They’re all slime molds,” says Keats. This is the first analysis of these issues by non-human scholars, he notes, asserting, “Their advice is objective, and transcends our polarized political environment because they don’t belong to our species.” (A slime mold was previously appointed to the Hampshire faculty.)”</li>

</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level3">
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>My hypothesis was partially correct and incorrect as proved by positive and negative growths in Trials 1 &amp; 2 (for the glucose solutions). This could suggest variations in the control variables like room temp, preparation of various concentrations of glucose, and health of Physarum culture. For example, the glucose we used was grape flavored and this could have affected the results seeing as the artificial flavor could have repelled the Physarum. The room temperature may have been different when the separate trials were conducted. The health of the Physarum Culture may have varied with the trials. The trials with the various concentrations of coffee solution was interesting, as we observed no growth in any of the filter strips in 5 petri dishes; one could interpret this as the Physarum avoiding toxic substance or the Physarum culture was unhealthy. If I were to repeat this experiment in the future, I would try to find unflavored glucose or make my own glucose solution, conduct trial 1 &amp; 2 on the same day at the same temperature, use cultures grown on a single petri dish. If I were to expand on this project, I would experiment chemotaxis on Physarum Polycephalum by placing glucose/oats (positive chemotaxis) and coffee/chilli pepper (negative chemotaxis) at the end of the maze, and see if the Physarum can find the quickest way to the glucose/oats or away from coffee/chilli pepper.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>My hypothesis that the Physarum Polycephalum will grow towards the higher concentrations of glucose was partially supported and partially refuted as proved by positive and negative growths in Trials 1 &amp; 2 (for various glucose concentrations; please see data/plots below). Trial results for coffee showed no growth (positive, negative or neutral) after a 2 day observation. Based on the results from both the glucose and coffee trials, determining chemotaxis on Physarum Polycephalum cultures per my hypothesis is inconsistent and therefore inconclusive.</p>
