<p>You can view a live stream by visiting the ip address of my pi in a browser on the same network. Y can find the ip address of your Raspberry Pi by typing ifconfig in the terminal and looking for the inet address.</p>
<p>Visit <raspberrypi_ip>:5000 in your browser to view the stream.</p>
<p>Note: To view the live stream on a different network than your Raspberry Pi, you can use ngrok to expose a local tunnel. Once downloaded, run ngrok with ./ngrok http 5000 and visit one of the generated links in your browser.</p>
